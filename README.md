- `nav_data.tsv`: Output file generated by the script (created after running the script).

## Usage
1. Open PowerShell in the repository directory.
2. Run the script:

   .\extract_nav.ps1
   ```
3. The script will download the latest NAV data and create `nav_data.tsv` with Scheme Name and Asset Value columns.

## Requirements

- Internet connection to download the data

## Output Format
The output file `nav_data.tsv` will have two columns:
